##### Glycam-Web is a web interface for modelling, simulating, and visualizing carbohydrates. You can find the development site at dev.glycam.org. You can also run it locally. See below.

### Running Glycam-Web Locally
Since Glycam-Web is open-source, users can run instances of Glycam-Web on their own servers. This may be desirable for at least two reasons. First, the computational work can sometimes be very expensive. Users running Glycam-Web on their own server can utilize their own resources and potentially speed up the work that is done. Second, the user may need the guarantee of confidentially.

See the [README](./WEB-INF/README) for instructions on building and running Glycam-Web.

### Enhancing Glycam-Web
Glycam-Web can be enhanced with the following closed-source software:
- [AMBER](http://ambermd.org/) - for minimization
- [NetOGlyc](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) - for determining likely O-glycosylation sites
- [NAccess](http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/) - for calculating solvent accessible surface area

See the [README](./WEB-INF/README) for instructions.
